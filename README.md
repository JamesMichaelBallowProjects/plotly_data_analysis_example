# Plotly Data Plotting Example
---
## Purpose
This repo is one of a collection of repos that I have to exhibit my programming/technical skills. In this repo, I exhibit the following:

1. Use of Kaggle to obtain a dataset.
2. Use of dataframes to manage large data (Pandas/Numpy).
3. Use of Plotly to visualize data.
4. Use of appropriate color scheme and layout practices.
5. Generation of standalone HTML file that visualizes data.
6. Understanding of the use of CDN in lieu of hard-copies of web styling files.

## Installation/Setup
This repo is simple, and requires only a few packages. You can set up the repo using the requirements text file provided in the code package. Follow these steps to get this repo up and running on your local machine:

1. Clone the repo to your machine.
2. Navigate to the repo on your machine.
3. Activate your python virtual environment (venv).
4. Install the required packages to your venv:
    ```powershell
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Code Execution
The code is relatively simple. The intention was to show example of knowledge, so it is kept to the simple execution of the main script, which is entitled ```plotly_example_analysis.py```. You can run this script using the following:

    python .\plotly_example_analysis.py
